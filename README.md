# MyJobPro+

A job finder and upskill prototype that made by using flutter.

## Things to take notes
* This project is a prototype that is used for the course LMCR3933. 
* I do not take the credit for the design. Most of the UI design is obtained from internet.
* Functionality like search, filter is not implemented.

## Getting Started
1. To run it , make sure an emulator or a device is connected to the computer.
2. Once is connected, simply run from the main.dart
